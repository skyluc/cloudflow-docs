Version1

The rapid advance and adoption of the Kubernetes ecosystem is finally delivering on the devops promise of giving control and responsibility to dev teams over the lifecycle of their applications.
Kubernetes also increases the complexity that developers need to manage to deliver an end-to-end application.
Cloudflow alleviates that pain for distributed streaming applications, which are known to be fairly more complex than the average front-end or microservice deployment.

Cloudflow enables you to quickly develop distributed streaming applications to deploy on Kubernetes. 
Using Cloudflow, you can easily break down your streaming application into small composable components and wire them together with schema-based contracts. 

Cloudflow integrates with popular streaming engines like Akka, Apache Spark, and Apache Flink. 
It also comes with a powerful CLI tool to easily manage, scale and configure your deployed streaming applications. 
With its powerful abstractions, Cloudflow enables you to define, build and deploy the most complex streaming applications.

To streamline the end-to-end application lifecycle, Cloudflow offers two sets of components: An API and CLI for local development and a cluster installation that extends your Kubernetes cluster with cloud-native streaming data capabilities.  

On the local development environment, the open-source Cloudflow application development toolkit includes:

- An API definition for `Streamlet`, the core abstraction in Cloudflow.
- An extensible set of runtime implementations for `Streamlet`(s). Cloudflow provides support for popular streaming runtimes, like Spark's Structured Streaming, Flink, and Akka.
- A `Streamlet` composition model driven by a `blueprint` definition. 
- A _Sandbox_ execution mode that accelerates the development and testing of your applications.
- A set of `sbt` plugins for packaging Cloudflow applications into a deployable container.
- A CLI, in the form of a `kubectl` plugin, that facilitates manual and scripted management of the application.  

On the Kubernetes cluster, the Cloudflow operator takes care of orchestrating the deployment of the different parts of a streaming pipeline as an end-to-end application.

Cloudflow dramatically accelerates your application development efforts, reducing the time required to create, package, and deploy an application from weeks to hours. Lightbend also offers support and enhanced deployment and operational features with a Lightbend Subscription.
